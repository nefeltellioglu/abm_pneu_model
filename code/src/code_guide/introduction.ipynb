    "The transmission model is an individual-based model that incorporates demographic and transmission dynamics. Each serotype is represented individually. We assume a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model for S. pneumoniae infection, where “infection” represents carriage of S. pneumoniae, and disease outcomes are considered for the infected individuals. Similar to previous modelling studies, the infectious duration for an individual is sampled from an exponential distribution with an age-specific mean infectious duration. Upon recovery, infectious individuals re-enter the susceptible class, with protection derived from antibodies according to the time since their last vaccination. \n"

    "Transmission within and between age groups is driven by contact rates, derived from synthetic contact matrices . In this work, we have assumed contacts in our population according to the contact matrices provided by Prem et al.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Carriage assumptions\n",
    "We assume that individuals are exposed to a single serotype at every time step. The exposed serotype is randomly selected from weighted serotype distribution in the population:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pr(Exposure to serotype a)=  ((τ_a  * I_a))/( ∑_s▒〖(τ_s  * I_s )   〗)\n",
    "\n",
    "where τ_a is the transmission coefficient multiplier of serotype a, I_a is the number of individuals infected by serotype a, and the denominator represents the sum of exposures by all the circulation serotypes, s. We then calculate the transmission of the exposed S. pneumoniae serotype for each individual. Individual infection risk for a particular serotype is determined by serotype prevalence, age, contact rates, current infection status and current antibody levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "Pr(Infection by serotype a | exposure to serotype a)= (1 - e^(-foi_i )) * V_a  * C\n",
    "\n",
    "where, foi_i represents the force of infection on an individual in age class i, V_a represents the vaccine-induced probability of acquisition multiplier to serotype a (see Section 2.1), and C represents the reduction of susceptibility given existing infections. We allow co-infections in the model assuming that individuals may be infected with multiple serotypes concurrently, with a reduced probability of acquiring another serotype if already infected, representing within-host competition. In this work, we assumed that C takes values of 1 (fully susceptible), 0.8 and 0 for the existing number of infections of 0, 1, and 2, respectively, which means that individuals could only be infected with two serotypes concurrently.\n",
    " The force of infection comprises age-specific community transmission:\n",

First, an external exposure rate simulates the ongoing introduction of serotypes through population migration, assumed to have the same age-specific and serotype-specific incidence of S. pneumoniae carriage as the local population (which maintains the same level of serotype and age specific carriage while population size increases). Second, introduction of any serotype sampled uniformly from the set of all possible serotypes and therefore may not be currently circulating within the local population (which allows possibility of serotype replacement under immune selection over time).\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Clinical model\n",
    "\n",
    "The clinical model takes information on the age and vaccine history of newly infected individuals from the transmission model, and the antibody levels at the time of infection, derived from these values, from the immunity model. The model then determines whether an infected individual develops a disease outcome (IPD or CAP), according to the relative probability of each occurring, and records the disease outcomes when they occur. In this work, we assume that 23vPPV is not effective against acquisition and developing CAP. \n",
