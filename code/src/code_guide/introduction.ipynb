    "## 1.1. *Streptococcus Pneumoniae*  <a name=\"spneu\"></a>\n",
    "*Streptococcus pneumoniae* (*S. pneumoniae*) causes respiratory infections which can then lead to non-invasive disease—such as otitis media and pneumonia—or invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), including meningitis and bacteraemia (Yildirim et al., 2010; Hausdorff et al., 2005). There are over 100 pneumococcal serotypes with varying prevalence by age and geographic location (Bertran et al., 2024; Hausdorff et al., 2005). Immunogenicity characteristics—such as the immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration required for protection and potential to cause invasive disease—also vary by serotype (Andrews et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2024; Hausdorff et al., 2005). \n",
    "\n",
    "Highest burden of morbidity and mortality caused by pneumococcus is mostly observed in low- and middle-income countries, and disproportionately affects children (Wunrow et al., 2023; Wahl et al., 2018). Due to the high burden of disease, several pneumococcal vaccines has been developed and administered with varying vaccine schedules globally (Bertran et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2024; Musher et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main oneumococcal vaccine categories: pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPVs) and pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs). It is assumed that PPVs provide protection against IPD, however, they show limited and variable efficacy in preventing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and do not provide protection against transmission (Moberley et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "PCVs enhance immunogenicity and effectiveness by inducing immune memory, including in young children (Musher et al., 2022). Conjugate vaccines protect against both infection and developing disease (O’Brien et al., 2007; Feemster et al., 2024). A seven-valent conjugate vaccine (7vPCV), first licensed in the USA in 2000 (Hausdorff et al., 2005; O’Brien et al., 2007). Serotype replacement and persistent burden of disease observed post-7vPCV introduction have lead to the development of higher-valency vaccines including a 13-valent PCV (13vPCV), a 15-valent PCV (15vPCV), a 20-valent PCV (20vPCV), and a 21-valent PCV (21vPCV) (Wunrow et al., 2023; Musher et al., 2022; Feemster et al., 2024; O’Brien et al., 2007). However, there is concern regarding declining immunogenicity against shared serotypes with higher-valency PCVs, with uncertain implications for effectiveness (Feemster et al., 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variability in serotype-specific immunogenic responses among multiple vaccine products requires a flexible approach to modelling the potential impacts of different vaccines. While previous models examining pneumococcal vaccines account for the multi-serotype nature of *S. pneumoniae* to some degree, they often depend on simplifying assumptions related to serotypes (e.g., vaccine-type groupings, restricted serotype sets), co-infections (e.g., assuming no co-infections within vaccine-type groups), immune response (e.g., homogeneous responses), and host representation (e.g., single-age-group focus) (Melegaro & Edmunds, 2004; De Cao et al., 2014; Wasserman et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2012; Flasche et al., 2013; Megiddo et al., 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, models that group serotypes into vaccine and non-vaccine types typically assume no co-infection within each serotype group, which prevents co-infection with two non-vaccine serotypes (e.g., De Cao et al., 2014). This assumption can alter transmission dynamics once vaccine-type serotype circulation decreases following vaccine introduction. Additionally, these models often assume a homogeneous vaccine-induced immune response across all vaccine-type serotypes (e.g., Megiddo et al., 2018), preventing incorporation of observed serotype-specific immunogenicity differences. These assumptions limit the exploration of vaccine program effectiveness and the impact of reduced immunogenicity of higher-valency vaccines.\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed a flexible individual-level modelling framework that incorporates differences in vaccine immunogenicity across individual serotypes, allowing estimation of relative correlates of protection using historical data. The manuscript that explains the model in more detail is avaiable as a preprint: [Tellioglu et al.](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.05.22.25327965v4). This guide explains the structure and contents of the code repository that includes the modelling framework.\n",

We assume a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model for *S. pneumoniae* infection, where “infection” represents carriage of *S. pneumoniae* (infectious symptomatic or asymptomatic colonisation of the nasopharynx by *S. pneumoniae*), and disease outcomes are considered for the infected individuals. \n"

    "Similar to previous modelling studies, the infectious duration for an individual is sampled from an exponential distribution with an age-specific mean infectious duration. Upon recovery, infectious individuals re-enter the susceptible class, with protection derived from antibodies according to the time since their last vaccination. \n",

    "Carriage of serotypes is determined in multiple steps (Fig 2).

We allow co-infections in the model assuming that individuals may be infected with multiple serotypes concurrently, with a reduced probability of acquiring another serotype if already infected, representing within-host competition. In this work, we assumed that $C$ takes values of 1 (fully susceptible), 0.8, and 0 for the existing number of infections of 0, 1, and 2, respectively, which means that individuals could only be infected with two serotypes concurrently. $C$ is assigned by two parameters: 'reduction_in_susceptibility_coinfections' and 'max_no_coinfections' which are set as 0.8 and 2, respectively. Parameter 'max_no_coinfections' can be set as higher values, however, in order to incorporate values other than 2 when population is going to be saved post simulation, population must be saved in a parquet file rather than 3 separate csv files. Current version of population recording assumes that individuals can have up to two co-infections. In addition, 'reduction_in_susceptibility_coinfections' only checks whether current number of co-infections is higher than one.

Disease outcomes (IPD or hospitalised CAP) are calculated at every time step. The new cases are recorded in P.disease_pop which is a pl.DataFrame that is restarted as a a new DataFrame at every year. This reinitialisation does not affect the transmission dynamics as it is assumed that developing disease do not have an impact on the transmission dynamics. In this work, we assume that 23vPPV is not effective against developing CAP, therefore, we separate individuals vaccinated by 23vPPV in the clinical model (Fig 3). \n",

Therefore, we first remove individuals who have already developed disease during a specific infection period. We check if the infected individual has vaccine-induced antibody levels against their infecting serotypes. Then, by using the probability of developing disease formulation, individual’s vaccine-induced antibody levels (zero if the individual is unvaccinated or the infecting serotype is not included in their vaccine type) and age, individuals risk status, severity multiplier of serotype a, the model determines whether an infected individual develops a disease outcome.  Then the clinical model decides whether the outcome is IPD or CAP based on the relative probability provided by `ipd_fraction_by_age_group` parameter of the Disease class.\n",

    "- Individuals receiving the first dose on time would also receive the following doses on time. \n",
    "- Maximum protection by a vaccine starts immediately.\n",
    "These two assumptions are hard coded. In order to make changes, `check_vaccines()` function must be updated.\n",

    "| `check_disease()`| Disease outcomes (IPD or hospitalised CAP) are calculated at every time step. The new cases are recorded in P.disease_pop which is a pl.DataFrame that is restarted as a a new DataFrame at every year. This reinitialisation does not affect the transmission dynamics as it is assumed that developing disease do not have an impact on the transmission dynamics. `check_disease()` is currently called in `check_exposure()` but it can be moved outside of `check_exposure()` function.|\n",
    "| `check_vaccines()`| At every time step, it checks each vaccine whether it's time to vaccinate individuals. If so, it identifies individuals who are going to vaccinated on time or late. For the \"on time\" vaccinations, it update individuals vaccine status and records \"no of doses\", \"final vaccine type\", \"final vaccination time\" in the individuals \"vaccine\" struct column. It identify individuals who are going to receive vaccination late in the upcoming time steps and assing \"final_vaccination_time\" as a negative \"time_to_vaccinate\" value. Later it checks individuals who are going to receive their late vaccination in current time by identifying individuals who have negative current time step in their \"final vaccination time\" column. The function is quite long and it needs to be seperated into different chunchs and they must be carried into \"vaccine.py\" for readability. The reason for the long function is that different types of vaccines has different conditions in their targeted group.|\n",
