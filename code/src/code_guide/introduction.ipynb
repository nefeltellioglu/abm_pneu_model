    "## 1.1. *Streptococcus Pneumoniae*  <a name=\"spneu\"></a>\n",
    "*Streptococcus pneumoniae* (*S. pneumoniae*) colonises the nasopharynx but can also cause infection and both non-invasive disease—such as otitis media and pneumonia—or invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD), including meningitis and bacteraemia (Yildirim et al., 2010; Hausdorff et al., 2005). Pathogenicity is largely, though not solely, determined by the polysaccharide capsular antigen (serotype) (Yildirim et al., 2010; Hausdorff et al., 2005). Over 100 pneumococcal serotypes have been identified, with varying prevalence by age and geographic location (Bertran et al., 2024; Hausdorff et al., 2005). Immunogenicity characteristics—such as the immunoglobulin G (IgG) concentration required for protection and potential to cause invasive disease—also vary by serotype (Andrews et al., 2014; Feng et al., 2024; Hausdorff et al., 2005). \n",
    "\n",
    "The substantial global burden of morbidity and mortality caused by pneumococcus is predominantly borne in low- and middle-income countries, and disproportionately affects children (Wunrow et al., 2023; Wahl et al., 2018). Older adults and children under five are also at risk in high-income settings (Grant, Slack, Theilacker, Vojicic, Dion, Reinert, Jodar, & Gessner, 2023; Grant, Slack, Theilacker, Vojicic, Dion, Reinert, Jodar, & Gessner, 2023). The notable burden of disease has driven the development of several pneumococcal vaccines administered according to different vaccine schedules (Bertran et al., 2024; Feng et al., 2024; Musher et al., 2022).\n",
    "\n",
    "The first vaccines comprising polysaccharide capsular antigens were poorly immunogenic in children aged <2 years (O’Brien et al., 1996; Douglas & Miles, 1984). Moreover, pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccines (PPVs) only activate the humoral arm of the immune system and fail to induce immune memory (Musher et al., 2022; Davies et al., 2022). Consequently, although PPVs provide protection against IPD, they show limited and variable efficacy in preventing community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) and do not reduce nasopharyngeal colonisation, thereby failing to interrupt transmission (Moberley et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "These limitations were overcome by the development of pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs), in which polysaccharides are conjugated to a carrier protein (Musher et al., 2022; Davies et al., 2022). Conjugation enhances immunogenicity and effectiveness by inducing immune memory, including in young children (Musher et al., 2022). Conjugate vaccines protect against both systemic and mucosal infection and prevent nasopharyngeal colonisation by vaccine serotypes, thereby reducing transmission in the community (O’Brien et al., 2007; Feemster et al., 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "A seven-valent conjugate vaccine (7vPCV), first licensed in the USA in 2000, included seven serotypes causing at least 70% of disease in young children in western industrialised countries (Hausdorff et al., 2005; O’Brien et al., 2007). However, serotype replacement and persistent burden of disease have driven the creation of higher-valency vaccines (Wunrow et al., 2023; Musher et al., 2022; Feemster et al., 2024; O’Brien et al., 2007). A 13-valent PCV (13vPCV) became available in 2010, and more recently 15vPCV, 20vPCV, and 21vPCV have been developed (Andrews et al., 2014; Musher et al., 2022; Feemster et al., 2024). However, there is concern regarding declining immunogenicity against shared serotypes with higher-valency PCVs, with uncertain implications for effectiveness (Feemster et al., 2024).\n",
    "\n",
    "Variability in serotype-specific immunogenic responses among multiple vaccine products necessitates a flexible approach to modelling the potential impacts of different vaccines. While previous models examining pneumococcal vaccines account for the multi-serotype nature of *S. pneumoniae* to some degree, they often depend on simplifying assumptions related to serotypes (e.g., vaccine-type groupings, restricted serotype sets), co-infections (e.g., assuming no co-infections within vaccine-type groups), immune response (e.g., homogeneous responses), and host representation (e.g., single-age-group focus) (Melegaro & Edmunds, 2004; De Cao et al., 2014; Wasserman et al., 2018; Choi et al., 2019; Choi et al., 2012; Flasche et al., 2013; Megiddo et al., 2018).\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, models that group serotypes into vaccine and non-vaccine types typically assume no co-infection within each serotype group, which prevents co-infection with two non-vaccine serotypes (e.g., De Cao et al., 2014). This assumption can alter transmission dynamics once vaccine-type serotype circulation decreases following vaccine introduction. Additionally, these models often assume a homogeneous vaccine-induced immune response across all vaccine-type serotypes (e.g., Megiddo et al., 2018), preventing incorporation of observed serotype-specific immunogenicity differences. These assumptions limit the exploration of vaccine program effectiveness and the impact of reduced immunogenicity of higher-valency vaccines.\n",
    "\n",
    "We developed a flexible individual-level modelling framework that incorporates differences in vaccine immunogenicity across individual serotypes, allowing estimation of relative correlates of protection using historical data. This guide explains the structure and contents of the modelling framework’s code repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1.2. Modelling Framework  <a name=\"framework\"></a>\n",
    "This repository includes an individual-based model that incorporates demographic and transmission dynamics of *Streptococcus pneumoniae*. Each serotype is represented individually. We assume a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model for *S. pneumoniae* infection, where “infection” represents carriage of *S. pneumoniae* (infectious symptomatic or asymptomatic colonisation of the nasopharynx by *S. pneumoniae*), and disease outcomes are considered for the infected individuals. \n"

    "##### Mixing assumptions\n",
    "Transmission within and between age groups is driven by contact rates, derived from synthetic contact matrices. In this work, we have assumed contacts in our population according to the contact matrices provided by Prem et al. (2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Carriage assumptions\n",
    "Similar to previous modelling studies, the infectious duration for an individual is sampled from an exponential distribution with an age-specific mean infectious duration. Upon recovery, infectious individuals re-enter the susceptible class, with protection derived from antibodies according to the time since their last vaccination. \n",
    "\n",
    "We assume that individuals are exposed to a single serotype at every time step. The exposed serotype is randomly selected from weighted serotype distribution in the population:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Pr(\\text{Exposure to serotype } a) = \\frac{\\tau_a * I_a}{\\sum_s (\\tau_s * I_s)}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\tau_a$ is the transmission coefficient multiplier of serotype $a$, $I_a$ is the number of individuals infected by serotype $a$, and the denominator represents the sum of exposures by all circulating serotypes $s$. We then calculate the transmission of the exposed *S. pneumoniae* serotype for each individual. Individual infection risk for a particular serotype is determined by serotype prevalence, age, contact rates, current infection status, and current antibody levels:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Pr(\\text{Infection by serotype } a \\mid \\text{exposure to serotype } a) = (1 - e^{-\\text{foi}_i}) \\, * V_a \\, * C\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- $\\text{foi}_i$ = Force of infection on an individual in age class $i$\n",
    "- $V_a$ = Vaccine-induced probability of acquisition multiplier to serotype $a$\n",
    "- $C$ = Reduction of susceptibility given existing infections\n",
    "\n",
    "We allow co-infections in the model, assuming that individuals may be infected with multiple serotypes concurrently, with a reduced probability of acquiring another serotype if already infected, representing within-host competition. In this work, we assumed that $C$ takes values of 1 (fully susceptible), 0.8, and 0 for the existing number of infections of 0, 1, and 2, respectively, which means that individuals could only be infected with two serotypes concurrently. $C$ is assigned by two parameters: 'reduction_in_susceptibility_coinfections' and 'max_no_coinfections' which are set as 0.8 and 2, respectively. Parameter 'max_no_coinfections' can be set as higher values, however, in order to incorporate values other than 2 when population is going to be saved post simulation, population must be saved in a parquet file rather than 3 separate csv files. Current version of population recording assumes that individuals can have up to two co-infections. In addition, 'reduction_in_susceptibility_coinfections' only checks whether current number of co-infections is higher than one. Therefore, there is no additional reduction in sussceptibility if individual is already infected by two or more serotypes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The force of infection comprises age-specific community transmission:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "##### Clinical model\n",
    "\n",
    "The clinical model takes information on the age and vaccine history of newly infected individuals from the transmission model, and the antibody levels at the time of infection, derived from these values, from the immunity model. Disease outcomes (IPD or hospitalised CAP) are calculated at every time step. The new cases are recorded in P.disease_pop which is a pl.DataFrame that is restarted as a a new DataFrame at every year. This reinitialisation does not affect the transmission dynamics as it is assumed that developing disease do not have an impact on the transmission dynamics. In this work, we assume that 23vPPV is not effective against acquisition and developing CAP. \n",
    " \n",
    "##### Vaccine Rollout\n",
    "The model simulates the implementation of historical vaccine schedules with their rollout years, eligible age range, annual fraction of on-time and late vaccine coverages of the eligible age group, number of doses and time interval between doses. We assume that individuals receiving the first dose on time would also receive the following doses on time. We also assume that maximum protection by a vaccine starts immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "#####  Single time step update of disease dynamics\n",
    "At every time step, disease transmission is updated in the update() function of a disease class based on the following order: \n",
    "\n",
    "- vaccine rollout (in check_vaccines function), \n",
    "- checking disease transmission, recovery, and disease outcomes (in check_exposure function), \n",
    "- checking external exposure to the community (in external_exposure function), \n",

    "| `check_disease()`| Disease outcomes (IPD or hospitalised CAP) are calculated at every time step. The new cases are recorded in P.disease_pop which is a pl.DataFrame that is restarted as a a new DataFrame at every year.

    "| `check_vaccines()`| At every time step, it checks each vaccine whether it's time to vaccinate individuals. If so, it identifies individuals who are going to vaccinated on time or late. For the \"on time\" vaccinations, it update individuals vaccine status and records \"no of doses\", \"final vaccine type\", \"final vaccination time\" in the individuals \"vaccine\" struct column. It identify individuals who are going to receive vaccination late in the upcoming time steps and assing \"final_vaccination_time\" as a negative \"time_to_vaccinate\" value. Later it checks individuals who are going to receive their late vaccination in current time by identifying individuals who have negative current time step in their \"final vaccination time\" column. The function is quite long and it needs to be seperated into different chunchs and they must be carried into \"vaccine.py\" for readability. The reason for the long function is that different types of vaccines has different conditions in their targeted group.|\n",
