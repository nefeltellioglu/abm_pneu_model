# Individual-based pneumococcal transmission model

## Installation

The code can be installed as a package. 

You can set up a Python virtual environment to run the code. Once you activate the virtual environment, you can run  `pip install -e .` after setting the current working directory as the code repository.

```shell
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# set working directory as code repository then
pip install -e .
```
