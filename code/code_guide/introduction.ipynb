    "# Introduction to the model\n",
    "The transmission model is an individual-based model that incorporates demographic and transmission dynamics. Each serotype is represented individually. We assume a susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) model for S. pneumoniae infection, where “infection” represents carriage of S. pneumoniae, and disease outcomes are considered for the infected individuals. Similar to previous modelling studies, the infectious duration for an individual is sampled from an exponential distribution with an age-specific mean infectious duration. Upon recovery, infectious individuals re-enter the susceptible class, with protection derived from antibodies according to the time since their last vaccination. \n"
